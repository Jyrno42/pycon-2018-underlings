## Teaser

Most of us are aware of EVE online being written in stackless python. However, when
python first introduced asyncio, J端rno had one question he wanted to figure out.
Can I write a game server in Python with the standard API? This talk is about
experiences of doing exactly that for a turn-based cardgame with RPG elements. You'll
learn about networking using asyncio and making the protocol play nicely together
with the statemachines which encapsulate the rules of the game.
